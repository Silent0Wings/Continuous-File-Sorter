# Continuous File Sorter for 3D and Digital Art

## Overview

This project is a Java-based file sorter designed to organize a large collection of files in an online dump, specifically focused on 3D and digital art assets. The tool continuously scans a designated folder, grouping files with common names into subfolders, making it easier to manage and access related files.

## Features

- **Continuous Sorting**: The sorter continuously monitors the target folder, sorting files as they are added.
- **Common Name Grouping**: Files with similar or common names are automatically grouped into appropriate subfolders, keeping related assets together.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to handle large volumes of files, making it ideal for organizing extensive collections of 3D models, textures, digital art, and other assets.
- **Customizable Sorting Criteria**: Users can define the rules for what constitutes a "common name" and customize the grouping behavior to fit their needs.

## Purpose

This tool was created to tackle the challenge of organizing a massive online dump of 3D and digital art assets. It automates the process of sorting files, making it easier to find, manage, and utilize the assets in a structured and organized way. The project also serves as an experiment to explore the efficiency and effectiveness of automated file sorting.

## Usage

- Start the program and specify the directory you want to monitor.
- The program will begin sorting files based on their names, creating subfolders where appropriate.
- The sorting process will continue as long as the program is running, automatically handling new files as they are added.
- use this to run the executable java files (.jar) files :
  - java -jar Better_sorter.jar
