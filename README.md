# Continuous-File-Sorter
This project is a Java-based file sorter designed to help organize a large collection of files in an online dump, particularly focused on 3D and digital art assets. The tool scans through a designated folder, continuously grouping files with common names into subfolders, making it easier to manage and access related files.
